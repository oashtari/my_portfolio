                        <p>Gunner is a GSP, which stands for German Shorthaired Pointer. Pointers are bred to be
                            bird hunting dogs, and with that comes an endless amount of energy because if they're in
                            the field, they need to keep going like the energizer bunny. Unless you hunt or love a
                            ton of outdoor time, this is not the dog for you. The breed is super human and dog
                        friendly, but their prey drive means they need something to do, ALL THE TIME.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Ory is a good ole house cat. She couldn't be any sweeter, but is also quite needy. For
                            good or bad, she basically follows me around when I'm at home. She's quite cute and
                            makes me smile, loves to sleep on my chest, so anytime I lay down, no matter where, she
                        figures it out and jumps on me (insert face palm emoji).</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Baker was the finally addition, he came in because when Ory was a kitten, we had to keep
                            her separate from Gunner, who do this day might think she's a squirrel. So Ory was in a
                            separate space, and quite lonely as a kitten, so we got Baker, and now they're best
                            friends. Baker is quite meow-y, he is always looking for something to do, and can be a
                            pain in Ory's behind, as well as mine. If he's hungry, or just needs attention, he'll
                        make sure I know, even if it's 2:30 in the morning...more FACE PALM.</p>
