                            <h3>Years 0-8</h3>
                            <p>I worked at two different talent agencies, the first one for less than a year. I
                                delivered mail, coffee, fruit, flowers, but eventually became a TV agent representing
                                writers, directors, producers and other TV talent.</p>

                            <h3>Years 8-11</h3>
                            <p>Turns out, I didn't love being an agent, so I had the opportunity to become a digital
                                agent as the world of YouTube stars was in its nascent stages. Still didn't love it, so
                                then there was a year long "what's next" expedition.</p>

                            <p>I joined a social platform, fortuitously for me, they needed someone in LA to spearhead
                                talent relationships. That turned into not just TV talent, but also sports, music and
                                other entertainers.</p>

                            <p>My curiosity had grown and working with talent was no longer of interest, but I was
                                fortunate to get an opportunity to learn, tackle and scale business operations with the
                                same group of colleagues, quite a learning period.</p>

                            <p>Utilizing that operations knowledge, I joined a small start-up focusing all my time on
                                bringing efficiency to the business and helping keep the doors open.</p>
